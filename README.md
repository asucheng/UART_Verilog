# UART_Verilog
The UART module consists of two main components: the receiver (RX) and the transmitter (TX). It operates at a baud rate of 115200 bits per second, using a 100 MHz system clock with 16× oversampling to achieve reliable data reception. Within each bit period, the valid sample is taken at the 8th sample point.

To ensure precise sampling, the UART top module generates a clock enable signal that defines the sampling interval for both the RX and TX modules. This interval is set to 54 clock cycles, derived from the system clock frequency over the oversampling multiplied by the baud rate. A counter increments on each rising clock edge and asserts the clock enable signal when it reaches 54.

The RX module receives a byte of data serially, bit by bit. The incoming data frame includes one start bit, eight data bits, and one stop bit. The RX state machine comprises 12 states: idle, start bit, eight data bit states, stop bit, and a complete state to signal that a valid byte has been received. Once a full byte is captured, the read_data_complete signal is asserted to indicate that the data is ready for processing.

Because each bit is oversampled 16 times, a sampling counter tracks the number of samples per bit. This counter increments on each clock enable pulse. The RX state machine remains in the current bit state until 16 samples have been collected, ensuring that each bit is sampled at the most accurate point before advancing to the next bit.

The transmission sequence starts when the send_data signal is asserted high. The TX state machine first sends a single start bit, followed by the eight data bits (transmitted least significant bit first), and finally one stop bit to complete the frame.

Like the RX, the TX module uses 16× oversampling to match the timing requirements of the receiver. A sampling counter keeps track of the oversampling process for each bit. This counter increments on each clock enable pulse generated by the UART top module. The TX state machine holds the current bit state until 16 samples have been counted, ensuring that each bit is held on the serial output line for the correct duration before moving on to the next bit.

When all bits, including the stop bit, have been transmitted, the TX module returns to the idle state, ready for the next send_data signal to trigger a new transmission.
